# **This is a work in progress**

# Feliz.ReactSpectrum
Feliz-style Fable bindings for Adobe's [React Spectrum components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/getting-started.html)

# Running the sample app / docs locally
- Make sure you have the [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed
- Run a `dotnet tool restore` in order to restore the tools required for building the bindings library and docs app
- Run `dotnet run RunDocs` - wait a bit and a browser window will open showing the docs app. The app will run in development mode, with hot module reloading enabled
