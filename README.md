# Feliz.ReactSpectrum
Feliz-style Fable bindings for Adobe's React Spectrum components.

# Running the sample app / docs locally
- Make sure you have .NET 6 installed
- Run a `dotnet tool restore` in order to restore the tools required for building the bindings library and docs app.
- Run `dotnet run RunDocs` - wait a bit and a browser window will open showing the docs app. The app will run in 'development' mode, with hot module reloading enabled.
